This website contains information about our paper entitled "Toward Improved DL-based Vulnerability detection."

The code we used to identify MBUs and IBUs can be found [here](code.zip). The readme file inside details how to use them.

The data we collected to identify MBUs and IBUs and the produced artifacts can be found [here](data.zip).

The analysis artifacts of the three DL-based detectors can be found here for: [ReVeal](Analysis/ReVeal.zip), [DeepWuKong](Analysis/DeepWuKong.zip), and [LineVul](Analysis/LineVul.zip).

The ground truth for our IBU and MBU patches can be found [here](Ground-truth.zip).
